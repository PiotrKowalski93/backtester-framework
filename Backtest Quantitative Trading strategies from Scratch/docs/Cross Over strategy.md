### What is a crossover strategy?

A moving average crossover is a popular trading strategy that uses two or more moving averages to identify potential buy and sell signals. The basic idea behind this strategy is to compare two moving averages of different lengths and look for a crossover where one moving average crosses above or below the the other.
